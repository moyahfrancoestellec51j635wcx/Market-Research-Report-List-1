<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung FLuid Status Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lung Fluid Status Monitor market includes both invasive and non-invasive types of monitors. Invasive monitors involve inserting a probe into the lung to directly measure fluid levels, providing more accurate results but with a higher risk of complications. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, do not require any insertion and instead use external sensors to measure fluid levels through the skin. While non-invasive monitors are generally considered safer, they may not be as precise as invasive monitors.</p></p>
