<p><h1>Absorbable and Non-Absorbable Sutures Market Size Growing and Forecasted for period from 2024 - 2031 and provides complete market analysis of this market</h1></p><p><strong>Absorbable and Non-Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Absorbable sutures are made from materials that can be broken down and absorbed by the body over time. These sutures do not require removal because they are naturally metabolized by the body. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are made from synthetic materials that do not break down and need to be removed by a healthcare provider.</p><p>The Absorbable and Non-Absorbable Sutures Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to factors such as the increasing number of surgical procedures, rising geriatric population, and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. Technological advancements in surgical procedures and an increasing focus on minimally invasive surgeries are also driving the demand for absorbable and non-absorbable sutures.</p><p>In terms of trends, there is a growing demand for bioabsorbable sutures due to their biocompatibility and reduced risk of infection. Additionally, there is a rising demand for non-absorbable sutures in cosmetic surgeries and dermatological procedures. The increasing adoption of advanced materials with improved tensile strength and knot security is also influencing market growth in the absorbable and non-absorbable sutures segment.</p></p>
