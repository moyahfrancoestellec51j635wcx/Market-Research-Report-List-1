<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Wet Processing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Fully-automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer wet processing systems are commonly categorized into three types based on their level of automation: semi-automatic, fully-automatic, and manual systems. Semi-automatic systems require some manual intervention during the wafer processing process, allowing for more control and flexibility. Fully-automatic systems involve minimal to no manual involvement, with the entire process being automated for higher throughput and efficiency. Manual systems, on the other hand, require complete manual operation by the user, making them less efficient compared to semi-automatic and fully-automatic systems.</p></p>
