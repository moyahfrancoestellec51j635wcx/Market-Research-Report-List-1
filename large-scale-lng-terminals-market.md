<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large-scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Regasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large-scale LNG terminals are facilities used for liquefying and regasifying liquefied natural gas (LNG). Liquefaction terminals are designed to cool natural gas to extremely low temperatures, transforming it into a liquid state for easier storage and transportation. These terminals house various equipment, such as heat exchangers and cryogenic tanks, to carry out this process. On the other hand, regasification terminals receive LNG in its liquid form and convert it back into a gaseous state before distribution through pipelines. These terminals play a crucial role in the global LNG supply chain.</p></p>
