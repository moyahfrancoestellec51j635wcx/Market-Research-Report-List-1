<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc</li><li>Air Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive air brake system market can be categorized into two main types: air disc brakes and air drum brakes. Air disc brakes use a caliper and pads to slow down the vehicle by pressing against a disc attached to the wheel, providing improved braking performance and heat dissipation. On the other hand, air drum brakes use a brake drum and shoes to create friction and slow down the vehicle. Both systems are commonly used in heavy-duty trucks and buses for their reliability and effectiveness.</p></p>
