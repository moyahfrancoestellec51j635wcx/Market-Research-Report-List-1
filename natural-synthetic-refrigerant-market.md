<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural & Synthetic Refrigerant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Refrigerants</li><li>Synthetic Refrigerants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural refrigerants are derived from natural sources such as air, water, and carbon dioxide. They are considered environmentally friendly as they have low global warming potential and ozone depletion potential. Synthetic refrigerants, on the other hand, are man-made chemicals that are used as coolants in refrigeration systems. They are effective in cooling but can have negative impacts on the environment if not handled properly. Both types of refrigerants play a key role in the refrigeration industry, with a growing demand for natural refrigerants due to their sustainable qualities.</p></p>
