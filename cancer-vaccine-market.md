<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cancer Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preventive vaccines</li><li>Therapeutic vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cancer vaccines can be broadly categorized into preventive vaccines and therapeutic vaccines. Preventive vaccines aim to prevent cancer by boosting the body's immune response against specific cancer-causing viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). On the other hand, therapeutic vaccines are designed to treat existing cancer by targeting tumor-specific antigens and stimulating the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Both types of vaccines have potential in the market to improve cancer prevention and treatment by harnessing the power of the immune system.</p></p>
