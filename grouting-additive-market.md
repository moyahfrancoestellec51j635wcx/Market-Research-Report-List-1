<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grouting Additive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Component</li><li>Two-Component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>One-component grouting additives are ready-to-use mixtures that contain all essential ingredients in a single package, simplifying the grouting process. They are convenient and easy to use, making them popular for small-scale projects. Two-component grouting additives consist of a resin and hardener that need to be mixed together before application. This allows for greater control over the grouting process and is commonly used for larger-scale projects where specific performance requirements need to be met. Both types of additives offer different advantages depending on the project scale and requirements.</p></p>
