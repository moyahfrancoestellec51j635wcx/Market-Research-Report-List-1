<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Bipolar Transistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NPN</li><li>PNP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive bipolar transistors are categorized into two main types based on their polarity: NPN and PNP transistors. NPN transistors have a positive-negative-positive configuration, where the current flows from the collector to the emitter when a positive voltage is applied to the base. On the other hand, PNP transistors have a negative-positive-negative configuration, where the current flows from the emitter to the collector when a positive voltage is applied to the base. Both types are commonly used in automotive electronics for amplification and switching applications.</p></p>
